### DoBu Martial Arts Project

## Project Overview:
DoBu Martial Arts Project is a visually appealing website crafted entirely with my own design. The development process involved translating my creative vision from paper sketches to wireframes and finally building the project.

## What I Learned:
Design to Development: This project provided an opportunity to execute a seamless transition from hand-drawn designs to a fully functional website.
Wireframing Skills: I honed my wireframing skills to create a structured blueprint for the project, ensuring a clear roadmap for development.
End-to-End Ownership: Taking charge of the entire design and development process enhanced my sense of ownership and creativity.

## How I Built It:
The project was meticulously crafted in three stages:
- Design Phase: Initial design concepts were sketched on paper, allowing me to explore creative possibilities.
- Wireframing: The chosen design was translated into wireframes, providing a structural blueprint for the website.
- Development: Using the wireframes as a guide, I brought the project to life through the implementation of HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript.

## Resources:
Design Tools: Hand-drawn sketches, wireframing tools (Edrawmax, Axure)
Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery
